This repo is used to coordinate the development, deployment and verification of Strategies by Badger DAO

## How to Add a new strategy for review

Create a new issue, with the name of the strategy, and the network it targets

Follow the issue template

## How to send the code for review

Create a Release in your Strategy Repository

Link to that release in the Strategy Issue


## Steps

Typically the strat will go through:

- Initial Review, where we will ask for revisions
- For each revision, make sure to tag a release
- Deployment, we will have you deploy the strat so it can be run, make sure to add the strategy to the registry under your address
- Review Board: The review board will review the code as well for any security risks
- Release: The strategy is live and the issue is closed, make sure to publish all addresses related to the strat and to verify all contracts
